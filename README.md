# Project Title: Car Price Prediction Project ðŸš— ðŸš˜ 
Description:
I am excited to share my latest project, the Car Price Prediction system! ðŸš—ðŸ’¸
In this project, I used linear regression machine learning techniques to develop a model that predicts car prices based on various features such as name, company, year, fuel_type and kms_driven. I implemented the model into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to effortlessly estimate car prices with just a few clicks.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy,pickel, Scikit-Learn
Streamlit
Machine Learning (Regression Algorithms)
